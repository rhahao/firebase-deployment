# Firebase Deployment

A GitHub Action to deploy firebase hosting and functions together.

- Make sure you have the `firebase.json` file in the root repository, or set a custom path to look for it using the `config` input.
- Set the project name in the `project` input.
- Get the Firebase token by running `firebase login:ci` and [store it](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) as the `FIREBASE_TOKEN` secret

## Example Usage

```yaml
name: Deploy to Firebase
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  main:
    name: Build and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Firebase
        uses: sws2apps/firebase-deployment@main #consider using pin for dependabot auto update
